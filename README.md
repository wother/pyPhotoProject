# FotoFoulge FotoManipulators #

These scripts are my exploration into what Python can do to
help automate parts of my photographic workflow. 

These include:
- rename file to standard format through metadata
- tag photos with google location API
- backup to cloud server (AWS)
- backup to physical media (DVD Burning)

Dependencies:
